            There's no sense in looking for self-love externally if you can't
            find it within yourself.
          </h3>

          <p>
            Sometimes it feels like we're searching for answers in all the wrong
            places. We often seek external validation and love from others,
            hoping it will fill the void within us. However, true self-love
            starts from within.
          </p>

          <p>
            Whether you're struggling with anxiety, depression, relationship
            issues, or simply feeling lost, remember that you
            <strong>don't have to face these challenges alone</strong>. Reach
            out, and <strong>let's work together</strong> to navigate the
            complexities of life and find the path to genuine self-love and
            happiness.

          <p>
            Hello, I'm Evelina. I want to share a bit of my own journey with
            you.
          </p>
          <p>
            Not too long ago, I was trapped in the cycle of
            <strong>seeking validation from others</strong>, battling
            <strong>self-doubt</strong>, and believing happiness came from
            external approval. But a pivotal moment changed everything. I
            realized that
            <strong>true happiness begins with self-acceptance.</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            This journey of embracing my uniqueness, flaws and all, led me to
            become a psychologist. Along this transformative path, I
            <strong>made a deliberate choice to pursue higher education</strong
            >, earning my Bachelor's degree in Psychology.
          </p>

          <p>
            My thirst for understanding the human mind and the complexities of
            our emotions led me to further studies. I completed my Master's
            degree in Clinical Psychology, specializing in self-esteem,
            self-love, and the treatment of depression.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm here to <strong>help you </strong>navigate your own path to
            self-acceptance because
            <strong>I've been there, and I understand</strong>. Together, we can
            discover your inner strength and resilience.

            opportunity to make your own sense. Thanks. I want to live now."
